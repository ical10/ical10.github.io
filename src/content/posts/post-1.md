## Overview

- Execute EVM contracts natively on Substrate-based chains
- Uses `pallet-revive` in Substrate runtime
- Supports Ethereum-like transactions and state transitions
- Benefits: Lower gas fees, faster transactions, interoperability with Substrate

---

## What is PolkaVM?

PolkaVM is a cutting-edge virtual machine tailored to **optimize smart contract execution** on Polkadot. 

Unlike traditional Ethereum Virtual Machines (EVM), PolkaVM is built with a **RISC-V-based register architecture** and a **64-bit word size**.

---

## Why RISC-V?

- Open Standard: allows for greater customization and innovation in VM design.
- Versatile: easy to transpile into common hardware formats such as x86, x64, and ARM.
- Simplicity and efficiency: simple and clean ISA leads to more efficient and easier optimization of smart contracts.
- 100x efficiency gains for ZK-EVM, see Vitalik proposal [here](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/long-term-l1-execution-layer-proposal-replace-the-evm-with-risc-v/23617).

## PolkaVM vs EVM (Part 1)

| Feature | PolkaVM | EVM |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Architecture | RISC-V-based register | Stack-based |
| Word Size | 64-bit | 256-bit |
| Optimization | Tailored for smart contract execution on Polkadot | General-purpose for Ethereum |
| Arithmetic Operations | Faster due to register architecture | Slower due to stack operations |
| Architecture | RISC-V-based register | Stack-based |
| Word Size | 64-bit | 256-bit |


---

## PolkaVM vs EVM (Part 2)


| Feature | PolkaVM | EVM |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Hardware Translation | More efficient | Less efficient |
| Language Integration | Seamless with C and Rust | Primarily Solidity |
| Scalability | Improved for modern blockchain applications | Limited by design |
| Ecosystem | Newer, growing | Well-established |


--- 


## PolkaVM vs EVM (Part 3)

| Feature | PolkaVM | EVM |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Gas Efficiency | Potentially more efficient with precise metering | Less efficient for complex operations |
| Memory Management | More flexible with 64-bit addressing | Limited by 256-bit word size |


---

## PolkaVM - Key Benefits

- Faster arithmetic operations and efficient hardware translation
- Seamless integration of high-performance languages like C and Rust for advanced optimization
- Improved scalability for modern blockchain applications

---

## Key Components

- **pallet_revive**: Runtime module executing smart contracts, converting Ethereum transactions for blockchain compatibility

- **PolkaVM**: Custom RISC-V-based VM optimized for performance, supporting Solidity and high-performance languages

- **Revive**: Compiler translating Solidity to RISC-V for PolkaVM, ensuring full Solidity compatibility

- **Revive Remix**: Modified Remix IDE with LLVM-based Revive backend for efficient Solidity contract deployment on Polkadot

---

## Key Considerations

- Gas Pricing: Custom or Ethereum model
- Account Management: Handle both Substrate and Ethereum accounts
- Storage: Manage EVM state in Substrate storage
- Performance: Balance EVM execution and chain performance

---

## Development Tools

- Remix: Web-based Solidity IDE
- Hardhat: Development environment for Ethereum
- Truffle: Testing framework for Ethereum
- Web3.js: JavaScript library for Ethereum interaction
- Ethers.js: Alternative JavaScript library for Ethereum

## Key Takeaway

You can run normal software compiled from normal programming languages (Rust, C, C++, etc) using normal abstractions on Polkadot _soon_.
