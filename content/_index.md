Welcome to my personal site, a place where I express my ideas and thoughts.

Most of the stuff you'll find here is about software engineering and web3, but more often than not there are also some of my personal interests: living on an island, understanding stoicism, learning math and physics, etc.

I hope you'll learn something useful here!
