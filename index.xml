Since it&amp;rsquo;s currently in development, things might have changed and what you&amp;rsquo;re going to read might not be valid anymore. Feel free to consult the official docs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="overview"&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Execute EVM contracts natively on Substrate-based chains&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uses &lt;code&gt;pallet-revive&lt;/code&gt; in Substrate runtime&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supports Ethereum-like transactions and state transitions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Benefits: Lower gas fees, faster transactions, interoperability with Substrate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-is-polkavm"&gt;What is PolkaVM?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PolkaVM is a cutting-edge virtual machine tailored to &lt;strong&gt;optimize smart contract execution&lt;/strong&gt; on Polkadot.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Substrate-based EVM Parachain Deployment Setup</title><link>https://ical10.github.io/posts/post-3/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ical10.github.io/posts/post-3/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="run-a-collator-node"&gt;Run A Collator Node&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h4 id="requirements"&gt;Requirements​&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most common way for a beginner to run a validator is on a cloud server running Linux. You may choose whatever VPS provider that you prefer. As OS it is best to use a recent Debian Linux. For this guide we will be using Ubuntu 22.04, but the instructions should be similar for other platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="reference-hardware"&gt;Reference Hardware​&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transaction weights in Polkadot are benchmarked on reference hardware. We ran the benchmark on VM instances of two major cloud providers: Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Amazon Web Services (AWS). To be specific, we used n2-standard-8 VM instance on GCP and c6i.4xlarge on AWS. It is recommended that the hardware used to run the validators at least matches the specs of the reference hardware in order to ensure they are able to process all blocks in time. If you use subpar hardware you will possibly run into performance issues, get less era points, and potentially even get slashed.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Substrate-based Relay Chain Deployment Setup</title><link>https://ical10.github.io/posts/post-2/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ical10.github.io/posts/post-2/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="run-a-validator-node"&gt;Run A Validator Node&lt;/h2&gt;
